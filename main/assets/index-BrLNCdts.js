Additionally, you can provide \`suggestionItems\`,
that are displayed in a popover right under the input.

The text field can be editable or read-only (\`readonly\` property),
and it can be enabled or disabled (\`disabled\` property).
To visualize semantic states, such as "error" or "warning", the \`valueState\` property is provided.
When the user makes changes to the text, the change event is fired,
which enables you to react on any text change.

**Note:** If you are using the \`Input\` as a single npm module,
don't forget to import the \`InputSuggestions\` module from
"@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js"
to enable the suggestions functionality.

### Keyboard Handling
The \`Input\` provides the following keyboard shortcuts:

- [Escape] - Closes the suggestion list, if open. If closed or not enabled, cancels changes and reverts to the value which the Input field had when it got the focus.
- [Enter] or [Return] - If suggestion list is open takes over the current matching item and closes it. If value state or group header is focused, does nothing.
- [Down] - Focuses the next matching item in the suggestion list.
- [Up] - Focuses the previous matching item in the suggestion list.
- [Home] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret before the first character. If focus is in the list, highlights the first item and updates the input accordingly.
- [End] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret after the last character. If focus is in the list, highlights the last item and updates the input accordingly.
- [Page Up] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight up by page size (10 items by default). If focus is in the input, does nothing.
- [Page Down] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight down by page size (10 items by default). If focus is in the input, does nothing.
