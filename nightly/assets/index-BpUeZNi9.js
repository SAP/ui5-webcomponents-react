size-limited window in front of the regular app screen.
It is used to prompt the user for an action or a confirmation.
The \`Dialog\` interrupts the current app processing as it is the only focused UI element and
the main screen is dimmed/blocked.
The dialog combines concepts known from other technologies where the windows have
names such as dialog box, dialog window, pop-up, pop-up window, alert box, or message box.

The \`Dialog\` is modal, which means that a user action is required before it is possible to return to the parent window.
To open multiple dialogs, each dialog element should be separate in the markup. This will ensure the correct modal behavior. Avoid nesting dialogs within each other.
The content of the \`Dialog\` is fully customizable.

### Structure
A \`Dialog\` consists of a header, content, and a footer for action buttons.
The \`Dialog\` is usually displayed at the center of the screen.
Its position can be changed by the user. To enable this, you need to set the property \`draggable\` accordingly.


### Responsive Behavior
The \`stretch\` property can be used to stretch the
\`Dialog\` on full screen.

**Note:** When a \`Bar\` is used in the header or in the footer, you should remove the default dialog's paddings.

For more information see the sample "Bar in Header/Footer".

### Keyboard Handling

#### Basic Navigation
When the \`Dialog\` has the \`draggable\` property set to \`true\` and the header is focused, the user can move the dialog
with the following keyboard shortcuts:

- [Up] or [Down] arrow keys - Move the dialog up/down.
- [Left] or [Right] arrow keys - Move the dialog left/right.

#### Resizing
When the \`Dialog\` has the \`resizable\` property set to \`true\` and the header is focused, the user can change the size of the dialog
with the following keyboard shortcuts:

- [Shift] + [Up] or [Down] - Decrease/Increase the height of the dialog.
- [Shift] + [Left] or [Right] - Decrease/Increase the width of the dialog.
