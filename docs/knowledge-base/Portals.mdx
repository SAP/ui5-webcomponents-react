This entry explains why portals are used in UI5 Web Components for React components and what you need to consider when using them.

## Why Portals?

In some cases when a React component like the `FilterBar` implements a popup component like a `Dialog`, , we use a [React Portal](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) to mount it outside the parents DOM hierarchy, to prevent unwanted side effects (e.g. wrong z-order).

For example:

```jsx
const DialogComponent = () => {
  const dialogRef = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    dialogRef.current.show();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={onButtonClick}>Open Dialog</Button>
      {createPortal(<Dialog ref={dialogRef} />, document.body)}
    </>
  );
};
```

<br />

## Pitfalls

In some cases you may want to add a class or attribute that is affecting all the components HTML elements. Since the popover is outside the DOM hierarchy of the most outer element of the component, the class/attribute/etc. will not be applied to it.
Or maybe you just don't want the popover to be mounted on the `body` element (which is the default).
For this we offer the `portalContainer` prop. This prop is available on all components that implement a popover, and with its help you can define the container into which the popover is mounted.

For example, if you want to display the `FilterBar` in compact mode, while the rest of the app stays in cozy mode, then you could achieve that like this:

Define a container somewhere in your DOM tree, where the portal should be rendered into and add the respective attribute/class/etc. to it.

```html
<div id="modalContainer" class="ui5-content-density-compact" />
```

Then, set the `portalContainer` to the respective element.

```jsx
<FilterBar
  className="ui5-content-density-compact"
  portalContainer={document.getElementById('modalContainer')}
  {...otherProps}
/>
```

<Footer style={{ position: 'fixed', bottom: 0, zIndex: 2 }} />
