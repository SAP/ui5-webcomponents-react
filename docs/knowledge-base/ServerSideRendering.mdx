# Server Side Rendering

We're happy to announce that starting from **v1.17.0**, UI5 Web Components for React is supporting Server Side Rendering Frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) ðŸŽ‰.

## Next.js

### Create a new project

The best way to start using UI5 Web Components in Next.js is using one of our [templates](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/?path=/docs/project-templates--docs).
We have templates available for both the pages and the app router.

### Add to existing project

In case you already have an existing Next.js project and want to add UI5 Web Components for React to it, you first need to follow our [general Getting Started Guide](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/?path=/docs/getting-started--docs#add-ui5webcomponents-react-to-an-existing-app).

As UI5 Web Components for React is using `react-jss` internally, you need to apply some changes to your `_app` and `_document` file (in case you are using the pages router).
You can copy these changes either from the official [next.js-react-jss example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-react-jss) or from our [pages router template](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/tree/main/examples/nextjs-pages).

In case you are already using the app router, you can copy the `react-jss` setup from the `app/CssRegistry.tsx` in our [app router template](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/tree/main/examples/nextjs-app). Make sure to add this component to your root layout!
