UI5 Web Components for React is a Fiori compliant React library built on top of the UI5 Web Components.
With the help of UI5 Web Components for React, you can use UI5 Web Components as if they were native React components.
In addition to that, UI5 Web Components for React is providing complex components and layouts on top of the UI5 Web Components.

<TableOfContent />

## Requirements

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) (**18.0.0 or higher**)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (**LTS version**)
- If you're using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) we recommend version **4.7** or later.

## End of Support for Version 1.x

The support for version 1.x of `ui5-webcomponents-react` has ended on **July 1, 2025**. We recommend migrating to version 2.x as soon as possible. For more information, please refer to our [Migration Guide](?path=/docs/migration-guide--docs).

## Getting Started

### Tutorial

You are new to UI5 Web Components for React and don't know where to start?<br />
Then take a look at our [Tutorial Mission](https://developers.sap.com/mission.react-spa.html) at “SAP Developers”!
There you get a first glimpse at how easy it is to create an Application with UI5 Web Components for React.<br />
In about an hour you will create a business dashboard from scratch and get familiar with some React basics in case you don't know them already.

### Examples & Templates

You can find a curated list of project templates and examples on our [Project Templates & Examples page](?path=/docs/project-templates-examples--docs).

### Download and Installation

You can install `@ui5/webcomponents-react` along with the required peer-dependencies based on the components you plan to use. **In most cases, the recommended installation is the most maintainable option.**

#### Recommended Installation

Install `@ui5/webcomponents-react` along with the `@ui5/webcomponents` and `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` peer-dependencies as dependencies in your project:

```sh
npm install @ui5/webcomponents-react @ui5/webcomponents @ui5/webcomponents-fiori
```

**Note:** If you import anything from another `@ui5/webcomponents-xyz` package, we recommend installing it as a dependency as well, even if it’s already included through another package.

#### Minimal Installation

Since version `v2.14.0` of `@ui5/webcomponents-react`, `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` is an optional peer-dependency. You will still need to install it if:

- You want to use any [component](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/components/fiori/) from the `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` package.
- You want to use the [VariantManagement](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/v2/?path=/docs/inputs-variantmanagement--docs) component.
- You import anything from the `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` package.

```sh
npm install @ui5/webcomponents-react @ui5/webcomponents
```

**Note:** Most popular bundlers enable tree-shaking for production builds, so there’s no difference in the final bundle size between the recommended and minimal installations.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> If your bundler does **not** support tree-shaking, you must use **subpath imports**.
>
> Otherwise, since `@ui5/webcomponents-react` re-exports all components, **every component** (including those that depend on the `@ui5/webcomponents-fiori` package) will be included in your bundle, which will lead to errors due to the missing module.
>
> **✅ Do:**
>
> ```tsx
> import { Button } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/Button';
> ```
>
> **❌ Don’t:**
>
> ```tsx
> import { Button } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react';
> ```

##### Importing Assets

The default assets import (`import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/dist/Assets.js';`) includes assets from the fiori package. Due to a limitation of Next.js (top-level await is not supported), we can't dynamically import the assets based on the installed packages.
If you are using the minimal installation, please import the assets manually as follows:

```ts
import '@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets.js';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/dist/json-imports/i18n.js';

//fetch
import '@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets-fetch.js';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/dist/json-imports/i18n-fetch.js';

//node
import '@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets-node.js';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/dist/json-imports/i18n-node.js';
```

### Version Alignment & Package Mapping

<VersionTable />

### Using UI5 Web Components for React

In order to use `@ui5/webcomponents-react` you have to wrap your application's root component into the `ThemeProvider` component.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/ThemeProvider';
...
createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>,
);
```

Then you are ready to use `@ui5/webcomponents-react` and you can import the desired component(s) in your app.
For example, to use the `Button` component you need to import it:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/Button'; // loads ui5-button wrapped in a ui5-webcomponents-react component
```

Then, you can use the Button in your app:

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => alert('Hello World!')}>Hello world!</Button>
```

### Theming

UI5 Web Components and UI5 Web Components for React are both coming with the `sap_fiori_3` a.k.a. `Quartz` and `sap_horizon` Theme families built in.

<MessageStrip
  hideCloseButton
  children={
    <>
      UI5 Web Components for React uses the theme configuration of UI5 Web Components. Please also have a look at their{' '}
      <Link href="https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/docs/advanced/configuration/#theme">documentation</Link>.
    </>
  }
/>

In case you want to change your applications' theme, you have to import a couple of modules:

```js
import { setTheme } from '@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Theme';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/dist/Assets';
```

You can now change the Theme by calling `setTheme` with a string parameter of the new theme.<br />
Available Themes:

- `sap_horizon` (default)
- `sap_horizon_dark`
- `sap_horizon_hcb`
- `sap_horizon_hcw`

- `sap_fiori_3`
- `sap_fiori_3_dark`
- `sap_fiori_3_hcb`
- `sap_fiori_3_hcw`

### Configure Compact/Cozy setting

UI5 Web Components supports `Compact` and `Cozy` mode. It is set to `Cozy` by default. To enable `Compact`, provide the css class `ui5-content-density-compact` to any of your HTML elements and it apply compact size to all of its children.

```html
<body class="ui5-content-density-compact">
  ...
</body>
```

### TypeScript

UI5 Web Components for React supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), therefore we also provide type interfaces for event parameters, public methods of `ui5-webcomponents`, and more.

You can find all available interfaces of the main package [here](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/tree/main/packages/main/src/interfaces) and for charts [here](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/tree/main/packages/charts/src/interfaces).

#### Example

Small app with a popover opened by clicking a button including type declarations:

```tsx
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import type { ButtonPropTypes } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/Button';
import type { PopoverDomRef, PopoverPropTypes } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/Popover';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/ThemeProvider';
import { Button } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/Button';
import { Popover } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/Popover';

export default function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState<PopoverPropTypes['open']>(false);
  const popoverRef = useRef<PopoverDomRef>(null);

  const handleClick: ButtonPropTypes['onClick'] = (e) => {
    setOpen(true);
  };
  const handleAfterClose: PopoverPropTypes['onClose'] = (e) => {
    setOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button id="opener" onClick={handleClick}>
        Open Popover
      </Button>
      <Popover ref={popoverRef} opener="opener" open={open} onClose={handleAfterClose}>
        Content
      </Popover>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Feature Registration

`@ui5/webcomponents` offers a variety of [feature (side-effect) imports](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/docs/advanced/using-features/) that are available with `@ui5/webcomponents-react` as well.
To use them you have to make sure they are imported before any other imports!
