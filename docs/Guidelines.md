# Development Conventions and Guidelines

## Requirements

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (**version 14 or higher** ⚠️)

## Setup your local development environment

Please make sure you have installed `node` 14 or higher (check by running `node -v`) and yarn v1 (check by running `yarn -v`).

First, you need to clone the git repository by running
```sh
# this git url points to the original repository, you can exchange it with the address of your fork
git clone https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react.git
```
Then, go into that cloned directory and run `yarn install`. At this point, you are ready to start local development. You can now run:

- `yarn start` <br />
  This starts the local storybook, so you can check if your components are rendered correctly. _If the storybook doesn't open automatically after executing the command, you can use this link: http://localhost:6006/_
- `yarn test` <br />
  This command is running all tests in the project. You can pass additional parameters according to the [jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli). Most probably you will only need the `--update` cli parameter when you have changed tests and want to update the snapshots.
- `yarn build` <br />
  This command executes the full build of the project.

## TypeScript

Please use TypeScript to write your components. A good introduction to TypeScript in React can be found [here](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/ultimate-react-component-patterns-with-typescript-2-8-82990c516935).

## Naming Convention for Props
- All Event handlers **must** start with `on`.<br />
   e.g. `onClick`, `onSelect`, `onSelectionChange`, .etc<br />
   All Events must pass an instance of the `Event`-Class as single parameter.
- When passing additional elements into a component, a slot should be used. This prop should contain a `ReactNode` or an array of ReactNodes (`ReactNode[]`)

You must follow the coding style as best you can when submitting code. Take note of naming conventions, separation of concerns, and formatting rules. You can use the code formatter [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to handle some of this for you automatically.

## Unit testing

All components should have associated unit tests created with a code coverage score of at least 85%. Be an overachiever and shoot for 100% :)

## Git Guidelines

We adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) specification.

### Commit Message Style
The commit message consists of three parts:
- header
- body (optional)
- footer (optional)

#### Commit Header
The commit header is the first line of the commit message. It consists of three parts: type, scope and description.

##### Commit Type
- It must be one of the following:
    + `fix` - a bug fix (note: this will indicate a release)
    + `feat` - a new feature (note: this will indicate a release)
    + `docs` - documentation only changes
    + `style` - changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
    + `refactor` - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    + `perf` - a code change that improves performance
    + `test` - adding missing tests
    + `chore` - changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
    + `revert` - revert to a commit
    + `WIP` - work in progress

##### Commit Scope (optional)
- It points to a specific component which is affected by the change. For example, ui5-button, ui5-card and ui5-table.

##### Commit Description
- Use the **imperative present tense**. Instead of "I added feature xy" or "Adding tests for" use "Add feature xy" or "Add tests for".
- It should be no more than **100 characters** long.


#### Commit Body (optional)
After the commit header, there should be an empty line followed by the optional commit body.
- Describe the intention and reasoning of the change.

#### Commit Footer (optional)
After the optional commit body, there should be an empty line followed by the optional footer.
- If the change introduces a breaking change, it should start with **BREAKING CHANGE:** followed by a description of the change.
    + `BREAKING CHANGE: remove press event`
- If the change fixes an issue reported on GitHub, add the following line to the commit message:
    + `Fixes #<issueNumber>` (e.g. `Fixes #42`)

#### Example
```
fix(text): correct focus with 'tab' key

The text should receive a correct focus outline
when the 'tab' key is pressed.

Fixes #42
```
