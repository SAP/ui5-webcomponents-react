UI5 Web Components for React is a Fiori3 compliant React library built on top of the UI5 Web Components.
With the help of UI5 Web Components for React, you can use UI5 Web Components as if they were native React components.
In addition to that, UI5 Web Components for React is providing complex components and layouts on top of the UI5 Web Components.

## Requirements

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React-DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) (**16.8.0 or higher**)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (**version 12 or higher** ⚠️)

## Getting Started

### Tutorial

You are new to UI5 Web Components for React and don't know where to start?<br />
Then take a look at our [Tutorial Mission](https://developers.sap.com/mission.react-spa.html) at “SAP Developers”!
There you get a first glimpse at how easy it is to create an Application with UI5 Web Components for React.<br />
In about an hour you will create a business dashboard from scratch and get familiar with some React basics in case you don't know them already.

### Creating a new React app

You can create a new react app by using [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) with our template.
This template is installing all required dependencies for you and is setting up the `App.js` file for you:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @ui5/webcomponents-react
# or if you want to use yarn
yarn create react-app my-app --template @ui5/webcomponents-react
```

### Creating a new React app based on our Seed

You can create a new react app by using [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) based on our seed.
This template delivers several out of the box components, scripts and configurations.
For more info, check the [seed documentation](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/tree/master/packages/cra-template-seed).

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @ui5/webcomponents-react-seed
npm run mock

# or if you want to use yarn
yarn create react-app my-app --template @ui5/webcomponents-react-seed
yarn mock
```

### Add `@ui5/webcomponents-react` to an existing app

First of all, you need to add the `@ui5/webcomponents-react` dependency to your project. Please also keep in mind installing the required peer dependencies:

```sh
npm install @ui5/webcomponents @ui5/webcomponents-react --save
# if you want to use the ShellBar or the ProductSwitcher component, you also need to install this package as well
npm install @ui5/webcomponents-fiori
```

In order to use `@ui5/webcomponents-react` you have to wrap your application's root component into the `ThemeProvider`.<br/>
You will find this component most likely in `src/App.js`:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/lib/ThemeProvider';
...
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeProvider>
        <MyApp />
      </ThemeProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then you are ready to use `@ui5/webcomponents-react` and you can import the desired component(s) in your app:<br />
For example, to use the `Button` component you need to import it:

```jsx
import { Button } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/lib/Button'; // loads ui5-button wrapped in a ui5-webcomponents-react component
```

Then, you can use the Button in your app:

```jsx
<Button onClick={() => alert('Hello World!')}>Hello world!</Button>
```

### Theming

UI5 Web Components and UI5 Web Components for React are both coming with the `sap_fiori_3` a.k.a. `Quartz` Theme built in.
In case you want to change your applications' theme, you have to import a couple of modules:

```js
import { setTheme } from '@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/Theme';
import '@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Assets';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/Assets'; // only if you are using the ShellBar, Product Switch or the Upload Collection
```

You can now change the Theme by calling `setTheme` with a string parameter of the new theme.<br />
Available Themes:

- `sap_fiori_3` (default)
- `sap_fiori_dark`
- `sap_belize`
- `sap_belize_hcb`
- `sap_belize_hcw`

### Configure Compact/Cozy setting

UI5 Web Components supports `Compact` and `Cozy` mode. It is set to `Cozy` by default. To enable `Compact`, provide the css class `ui5-content-density-compact` to any of your HTML elements and it apply compact size to all of its children.

```html
<body class="ui5-content-density-compact">
  ...
</body>
```
