# Test Setup

This guide is applicable if you are using a standard `create-react-app` setup.

<TableOfContent />

## Transpile Modules

`create-react-app` offers you to modify specific parts of the `jest` config by adding `jest` object to your `package.json`.
Here you need to tell `jest` to transpile the UI5 Web Components as well as the `lit-html` library:<br />
`package.json:`

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transformIgnorePatterns": ["node_modules/(?!(@ui5|lit-html)).*\\.js$"]
  }
}
```

In case you are using our chart library `@ui5/webcomponents-react-charts` as well, you'll have to add `d3` and `internmap` to the configuration:

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transformIgnorePatterns": ["node_modules/(?!(@ui5|lit-html|d3|internmap)).*\\.js$"]
  }
}
```

## Mocking

### Resize Observer

Since some components of UI5 Web Components and UI5 Web Components for React are based on the `ResizeObserver` API, you'll need to add a polyfill for it.
Our recommendation is the `resize-observer-polyfill` package, you can install it by running `npm install resize-observer-polyfill --save-dev`.

### React.useId

If you want to test your app by creating snapshots, you may need to mock the `useId` hook offered by React since version 18.
This hook returns a unique id across all components, but as your snapshot should be stable you can't have it there.

```js
jest.mock('react', () => {
  return { ...jest.requireActual('react'), useId: () => ':mocked' };
});
```

  Snapshot testing is a{' '}
  <ui5-link href={'https://kentcdodds.com/blog/effective-snapshot-testing'}>controversial and complex topic</ui5-link>,
  but especially with web components it gets really tricky as the JSDOM doesn't support rendering the shadow-root out of
  the box. That's why we recommend to go without extensively using snapshots.

## Jest Setup File

All other prerequisites of the UI5 Web Components for React Library can be fulfilled by importing our jest setup file:
`import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/jestSetup.js';`

Therefore, create (or edit) your `src/setupTests.js` file as follows:

```js
import ResizeObserverPolyfill from 'resize-observer-polyfill';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/jestSetup.js';

window.ResizeObserver = ResizeObserverPolyfill;

jest.mock('react', () => {
  return { ...jest.requireActual('react'), useId: () => ':mocked' };
});
```

<MessageStrip hideCloseButton>
  Please note that you must also wrap your components in the `ThemeProvider` component for testing, otherwise components
  with translations will probably not render.
</MessageStrip>

Now you should be able to run your test by using `npm run test` or `yarn test`.
