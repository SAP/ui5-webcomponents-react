# How can I style my Web Components?

[Open Github Project](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react)

## Change styles for existing components

You can easily change the appearance of the Web Components by using [CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_variables.asp).
Per default, we are injecting the Fiori 3 theme parameters as CSS Variables into the `document head`.
If you want to change e.g. the color of all texts, you can do that by creating another `style` element with the following content:

```html
<style>
  --sapTextColor: limegreen;
</style>
```

As a consequence, all HTML Elements in the subtree where this style was applied are now displaying their texts in `limegreen` instead of `#32363a` which would be the default value for Fiori 3.
You can change CSS Variables on any level - in the head, or on every single element by using either CSS classes or element style.

A full list of all supported CSS Variables can be found [here](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/blob/master/packages/base/src/styling/ThemingParameters.ts)
or in the [SAPUI5 Theming Parameters Toolbox](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/theming/webapp/index.html).

## Reuse global style classes

The `ThemeProvider` component is offering global css classes that can be reused in your applications code to help you to achieve a Fiori look-and-feel.
All globally available style classes are tracked in the `GlobalStyleClasses` enum which can be imported from `import { GlobalStyleClasses } from "@ui5/webcomponents-react/lib/GlobalStyleClasses";`.

| CSS Class      | Description                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sapScrollBar` | If added to an container that supports scrolling, the scrollbar will be styled according to the Fiori guidelines. |

## Style your own components

It's quite likely that you have to create some custom components when you are building an app.
In order to reuse our central styling approach, you can import the `ThemingParameters` that contain the various CSS variables used in our theming.
If you want to style your components with the `react-jss` syntax, you can use our custom `jss` styling hook.

`react-jss` comes already as a dependency of `@ui5/webcomponents-react` to your project - but we recommend adding it to your `package.json` as well.
**Please make sure you are installing `"react-jss": "^10.0.0"`**. Previous versions of this library won't work correctly together with our library.

You can then create a custom component by following this recipe:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { createUseStyles } from 'react-jss';
import { ThemingParameters } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react-base/lib/ThemingParameters';

const styles = {
  container: {
    backgroundColor: ThemingParameters.sapBackgroundColor,
    fontFamily: ThemingParameters.sapFontFamily,
    height: '50px',
    display: 'flex',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center'
  }
};

const useStyles = createUseStyles(styles, {name: "MyCustomElement"});

const MyCustomElement = () => {
  const classes = useStyles();
  return (
    <div className={classes.container}>
      <span style={{ color: ThemingParameters.sapNegativeColor, fontSize: ThemingParameters.sapFontLargeSize }}>
        My Text
      </span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This would then be the result:

<ThemeProvider>
  <MyCustomElement />
</ThemeProvider>
