# Migration Guide

<br />

_The most important breaking changes of the corresponding releases are outlined here.
For a full list of all changes, please refer to [the list of releases](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/releases)
or the [changelog](?path=/docs/change-log--page)._

<TableOfContent headingSelector="h2" />

## From 0.27.x to 0.28.0

### AnalyticalTable: Scaling the table

Scaling the table via the CSS `scale()` function is now only supported if the abscissa (`sx`) is passed to the `scaleXFactor` prop. `scaleXFactor` only accepts values of type `number`.

Before 0.28.0:

```jsx
<div style={{ transform: 'scale(0.5)' }}>
  <AnalyticalTable data={data} columns={columns} />
</div>
```

Now:

```jsx
<div style={{ transform: 'scale(0.5)' }}>
  <AnalyticalTable data={data} columns={columns} scaleXFactor={0.5} />
</div>
```

### MessageItem: new default value for `type`

The default value `type` value of the `MessageItem` component has been changed from `ValueState.None` to `ValueState.Error`.

### ObjectPage: `portalContainer` prop removed

The prop `portalContainer` has been removed from the `ObjectPage` as it is not used anymore.

## From 0.25.x to 0.26.0

### Removed deprecated entrypoints

In version 0.26.0, we have removed several legacy exports which have been deprecated a couple of months ago.
This affects all exports using the following pattern:

```js
import { COMPONENT_NAME } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react/dist/COMPONENT_NAME';
import { UTIL_NAME } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react-base/dist/UTIL_NAME';
import { CHART_NAME } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react-charts/dist/CHART_NAME';
```

You can now shorten all your imports by removing the `/dist/NAME` part to match the following pattern:

```js
import { COMPONENT_NAME } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react';
import { UTIL_NAME } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react-base';
import { CHART_NAME } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react-charts';
```

In case the file you are trying to import is not available, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md).

### Removed polyfills

In 0.26.0, we have removed the polyfill imports `@ui5/webcomponents-react-base/polyfill/Safari` (all features supported now) and `@ui5/webcomponents-react-base/polyfill/IE11` (end of life).
As a consequence, the internal dependencies of `@ui5/webcomponents-react-base` are cleaned up as well,
so you'll most likely need to install `resize-observer-polyfill` on your own for running tests with Jest (see next section).

```shell
npm install resize-observer-polyfill --save-dev
# or if you are using yarn
yarn add resize-observer-polyfill --dev
```

### Improved Jest Setup

In order to run Tests with Jest, there has always been the need of adding additional polyfills to the Jest environment.
With 0.26.0, things are changing a little:

1. You have to install `resize-observer-polyfill` on your own because it's not longer a dependency of `@ui5/webcomponents-react-base`.
   ```
   npm install resize-observer-polyfill --save-dev
   ```
2. We now offer an improved way of adding the additional APIs to the Jest environment by exposing a file which is setting up the
   jest environment for you. You can import it via `import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/jestSetup.js';`.

If you are using `create-react-app`, your simplified `src/setupTests.js` file looks like:

```js
import ResizeObserverPolyfill from 'resize-observer-polyfill';
import '@ui5/webcomponents-react/jestSetup.js';

window.ResizeObserver = ResizeObserverPolyfill;
```

### New API for `AnalyticalCardHeader`

The `AnalyticalCardHeader` component has been refactored to match the latest design specifications.
As a consequence, the API has changed:

```jsx
function OldApi() {
  return (
    <AnalyticalCardHeader
      titleText="Title"
      subtitleText="Subtitle"
      arrowIndicator={DeviationIndicator.Up} // renamed to `trend`
      showIndicator={true} // removed, please use `trend={DeviationIndicator.None}` in future
      indicatorState={ValueState.Error} // removed without replacement
      value="100"
      unit="k" // renamed to `scale`
      valueState={ValueState.Success} // renamed to `state`, allowed enum values coming from `ValueColor`
      target="100" // replaced with `children`. Use the `NumericSideIndicator` component.
      deviation="50" // replaced with `children`. Use the `NumericSideIndicator` component.
      description="Additional Description"
      counter="Hello Counter" // renamed to `status`
      counterState={ValueState.Error} // removed without replacement
      currency="CURRENCY" // renamed to `unitOfMeasurement`
      onClick={(e) => {}}
    />
  );
}

// will become

function NewAPI() {
  return (
    <AnalyticalCardHeader
      titleText="Title"
      subtitleText="Subtitle"
      trend={DeviationIndicator.Up}
      value="100"
      scale="k"
      state={ValueColor.Good}
      description="Additional Description"
      status="Hello Counter"
      unitOfMeasurement="CURRENCY"
      onClick={(e) => {}}
    >
      <NumericSideIndicator titleText="Target" number="100" />
      <NumericSideIndicator titleText="Deviation" number="50" />
    </AnalyticalCardHeader>
  );
}
```

## From 0.23.x to 0.24.0

- The deprecated `tooltip` prop has been removed, please use the native `title` attribute instead. (This does not remove the `tooltip` prop of the `Button`, `ToggleButton` or `SegmentedButtonItem`.)
- The deprecated `useConsolidatedRef` hook has been removed, please use `useSyncRef` instead.
- The deprecated `StyleClassHelper` class has been removed, please use `clsx` instead or implement your own `className` constructor.

## From 0.21.x to 0.22.0

**useI18nBundle:** The `useI18nBundle` hook must now be used in the context of the `ThemeProvider`.

You will not need to change anything in your app's code base, since all components should already be wrapped by the `ThemeProvider`, but now you have to make sure that even your test components are wrapped inside of it.
Otherwise, translatable components will likely not render.
