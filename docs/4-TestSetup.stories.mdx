# Test Setup for UI5 Web Components for React

This guide is applicable if you are using a standard `create-react-app` setup.

## Install the jsdom 16 jest environment

As the UI5 Web Components are based on the `customElements` Web Standard, you need to install the latest version of `jsdom` to your project and tell the `jest` test runner to use it.
Therefore you need to install the `jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen` npm package.

```sh
npm install jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen --save-dev
# OR
yarn add jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen -D
```

## Tell jest to transpile the UI5 Web Components

`create-react-app` offers you to modify specific parts of the `jest` config by adding `jest` object to your `package.json`.
Here you need to tell `jest` to transpile the UI5 Web Components as well as the `lit-html` library:<br />
`package.json:`

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "transformIgnorePatterns": ["node_modules/(?!(@ui5|lit-html)).*\\.js$"]
  }
}
```

## Modify the test script

In order to tell the `jest` runner of `create-react-app` to use our newly installed jest environment, you need to add
one addition parameter to the `test` script: `--env jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen`. Your scripts should now look like:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

Now you should be able to run your test by using `npm run test` or `yarn test`.
