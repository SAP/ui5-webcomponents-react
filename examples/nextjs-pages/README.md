## UI5 Web Components React - Next.js Pages Router Example

This example shows how to use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Pages Router with UI5 Web Components for React.
It includes the required adjustments in `pages/_app.tsx` and `pages/_document.tsx` as well as a very simple Todo
App.

## How to use this template

```bash
npx degit SAP/ui5-webcomponents-react/examples/nextjs-pages#main my-project
cd my-project
```

## Getting Started

First, install the node_modules:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/todods](http://localhost:3000/api/todos). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/todos.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
