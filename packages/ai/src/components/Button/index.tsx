/**
 * The `Button` component serves as a button for AI-related scenarios. Users can trigger actions by clicking or tapping the `Button`
 * or by pressing keyboard keys like [Enter] or [Space].
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * For the `Button` user interface, you can define one or more button states by placing `ButtonState` components in their default slot.
 * Each state has a name for identification and can include text, an icon, and an end icon, as needed for its purpose.
 * You can define a split mode for the `Button`, which will results in displaying an arrow button for additional actions.
 *
 * You can choose from a set of predefined designs for `Button` (as in `ui5-button`) to match the desired styling.
 *
 * The `Button` can be activated by clicking or tapping it. You can change the button state in the click event handler. When the button is
 * in split mode, you can activate the default button action by clicking or tapping it, or by pressing keyboard keys like [Enter] or [Space].
 * You can activate the arrow button by clicking or tapping it, or by pressing keyboard keys like [Arrow Up], [Arrow Down], or [F4].
 * To display additional actions, you can attach a menu to the arrow button.
 *
