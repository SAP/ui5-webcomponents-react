/**
 * The `TableSelection` component is used inside the `Table` ti add key-based selection capabilities to the `Table`.
 *
 * The component offers three selection modes:
 * * Single - select a single row.
 * * Multiple - select multiple rows.
 * * None - no selection active.
 *
 * As the selection is key-based, `TableRow` components need to define a unique `row-key` property.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `TableSelection` component is only used inside the `Table` component as a feature.
 * It has to be slotted inside the `Table` in the `features` slot.
 * The component is not intended to be used as a standalone component.
 *
 * ```html
 * <Table>
 * 	<TableSelection mode="Multiple" slot="features"></TableSelection>
 * </Table>
 * ```
 *
