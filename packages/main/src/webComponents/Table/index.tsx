/**
 * The `Table` component provides a set of sophisticated and convenient functions for responsive table design. It provides a comprehensive set of features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts of data.
 *
 * To render the `Table` properly, the order of the `columns` should match with the order of the item `cells` in the `rows`.
 *
 * Desktop and tablet devices are supported. On tablets, special consideration should be given to the number of visible columns and rows due to the limited performance of some devices.
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Componentsâ€™ team.
