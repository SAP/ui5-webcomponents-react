### Fast Navigation

This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via `F6 / Shift + F6` or `Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Down / Ctrl + Alt(Option) + Up`. In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module: `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`  
  

## Calendar types

The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian. By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese or Persian calendar, you need to set the `primaryCalendarType` property and import one or more of the following modules:  
  
`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Buddhist.js";`  
`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js";`  
`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Japanese.js";`  
`import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Persian.js";`  
  
Or, you can use the global configuration and set the `calendarType` key:  
`<script data-id="sap-ui-config" type="application/json"> { "calendarType": "Japanese" } </script>`
