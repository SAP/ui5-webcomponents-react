/**
 * The `Wizard` helps users to complete a complex task by dividing it into sections and guiding them through it.
 * It has two main areas - a navigation area at the top showing the step sequence and a content area below it.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * #### Navigation area
 * The top most area of the `Wizard` is occupied by the navigation area.
 * It shows the sequence of steps, where the recommended number of steps is between 3 and 8 steps.
 *
 * -  Steps can have different visual representations - numbers or icons.
 * -  Steps might have labels for better readability - titleText and subTitleText.
 * -  Steps are defined by using the `WizardStep` as slotted element within the `Wizard`.
 *
 * **Note:** If no selected step is defined, the first step will be auto selected.
 *
 * **Note:** If multiple selected steps are defined, the last step will be selected.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The user can navigate using the following keyboard shortcuts:
 *
 * #### Wizard Progress Navigation
 *
 * 	- [Left] or [Down] - Focus moves backward to the WizardProgressNavAnchors.
 * 	- [Up] or [Right] - Focus moves forward to the WizardProgressNavAnchor.
 * 	- [Space] / [Enter] or [Return] - Selects an active step
 * 	- [Home] or [PAGE UP] - Focus goes to the first step
 * 	- [End] or [PAGE DOWN] - Focus goes to the last step
 *
 * #### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 * #### Content
 * The content occupies the main part of the page. It can hold any type of HTML elements.
 * It's defined by using the `WizardStep` as slotted element within the `Wizard`.
 *
 * ### Scrolling
 * The component handles user scrolling by selecting the closest step, based on the current scroll position
 * and scrolls to particular place, when the user clicks on the step within the navigation area.
 *
 * **Important:** In order the component's scrolling behaviour to work, it has to be limited from the outside parent element in terms of height.
 * The component or its parent has to be given percentage or absolute height. Otherwise, the component will be scrolled out with the entire page.
 *
 * **For example:**
 *
 * ```html
 * <ui5-dialog style="height: 80%">
 * 	<Wizard></Wizard>
 * </ui5-dialog>
 * ```
 *
 * #### Moving to next step
 * The `WizardStep` provides the necessary API and it's up to the user of the component to use it to move to the next step.
 * You have to set its `selected` property (and remove the `disabled` one if set) to `true`.
 * The `Wizard` will automatically scroll to the content of the newly selected step.
 *
 * The Fiori 3 guidelines recommends having a "nextStep" button in the content area.
 * You can place a button, or any other type of element to trigger step change, inside the `WizardStep`,
 * and show/hide it when certain fields are filled or user defined criteria is met.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * #### When to use:
 * When the user has to accomplish a long or unfamiliar task.
 *
 * #### When not to use:
 * When the task has less than 3 steps.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 * On small widths the step's titleText, subtitleText and separators in the navigation area shrink and from particular point the steps are grouped together and overlap.
 * Tapping on them will show a popover to select the step to navigate to. On mobile device, the grouped steps are presented within a dialog.
 *
 *  (includes <ui5-wizard-step/>)
