## Structure

A `Dialog` consists of a header, content, and a footer for action buttons. The `Dialog` is usually displayed at the center of the screen. Its position can be changed by the user. To enable this, you need to set the property `draggable` accordingly.

## Responsive Behavior

The `stretch` property can be used to stretch the `Dialog` on full screen.
