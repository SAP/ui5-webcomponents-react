## Keyboard Handling

The `MediaGallery` provides advanced keyboard handling.  
When the thumbnails menu is focused the following keyboard shortcuts allow the user to navigate through the thumbnail items:

- \[UP/DOWN\] - Navigates up and down the items
- \[HOME\] - Navigates to first item
- \[END\] - Navigates to the last item
- \[SPACE/ENTER\] - Select an item
