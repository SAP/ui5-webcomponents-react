/**
 * Title of the `DynamicPage`.
 *
 * The `DynamicPageTitle` component is part of the `DynamicPage`
 * family and is used to serve as title of the `DynamicPage`.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `DynamicPageTitle` can hold any component and displays the most important
 * information regarding the object that will always remain visible while scrolling.
 *
 * **Note:** The `actions` slot accepts any UI5 web component, but it's
 * recommended to use `ui5-toolbar`.
 *
 * The user can switch between the expanded/collapsed states of the
 * `DynamicPage` by clicking on the `DynamicPageTitle`
 * or by using the expand/collapse visual indicators, positioned at the bottom of the
 * `DynamicPageTitle` and the `DynamicPageHeader` inside `ui5-dynamic-page-header-actions`.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 *
 * The responsive behavior of the `DynamicPageTitle` depends on the behavior of the
 * content that is displayed.
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
 *
 * @since [2.0.0](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0) of __@ui5/webcomponents-fiori__.
