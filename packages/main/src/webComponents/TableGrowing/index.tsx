/**
 * The `TableGrowing` component is used inside the `Table` to add a growing/data loading functionalities
 * to the table.
 *
 * The component offers two options:
 * * Button - a More button is displayed, clicking it will load more data.
 * * Scroll - additional data is loaded automatically when the user scrolls to the end of the table.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `TableGrowing` component is only used inside the `Table` component as a feature.
 * It has to be slotted inside the `Table` in the `features` slot.
 * The component is not intended to be used as a standalone component.
 *
 * ```html
 * <Table>
 * 	<TableGrowing mode="Button" text="More" slot="features"></TableGrowing>
 * </Table>
 * ```
 *
 * **Notes**:
 * * When the `TableGrowing` component is used with the `Scroll` mode and the table is currently not scrollable,
 * the component will render a growing button instead to ensure growing capabilities until the table becomes scrollable.
 *
 *
