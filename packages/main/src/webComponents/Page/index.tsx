/**
 * The `Page` is a container component that holds one whole screen of an application.
 * The page has three distinct areas that can hold content - a header, content area and a footer.
 * ### Structure
 * #### Header
 * The top most area of the page is occupied by the header. The standard header includes a navigation button and a title.
 * #### Content
 * The content occupies the main part of the page. Only the content area is scrollable by default.
 * This can be prevented by setting  `enableScrolling` to `false`.
 * #### Footer
 * The footer is optional and occupies the part above the bottom part of the content. Alternatively, the footer can be fixed at the bottom of the page by enabling the `fixedFooter` property.
 *
 * **Note:** `Page` occipues the whole available space of its parent. In order to achieve the intended design you have to make sure
 * that there is enough space for the `Page` to be rendered.
 * **Note:** In order for the `Page` to be displayed, the parent element should have fixed height.
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
