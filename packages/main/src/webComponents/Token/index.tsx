   * __Note:__ When passing a custom React component to this prop, you have to make sure your component reads the `slot` prop and appends it to the most outer element of your component.
   * Learn more about it [here](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/?path=/docs/knowledge-base-handling-slots--page).
