/**
 * The `Input` component allows the user to enter and edit text or numeric values in one line.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide `suggestionItems`,
 * that are displayed in a popover right under the input.
 *
 * The text field can be editable or read-only (`readonly` property),
 * and it can be enabled or disabled (`disabled` property).
 * To visualize semantic states, such as "Negative" or "Critical", the `valueState` property is provided.
 * When the user makes changes to the text, the change event is fired,
 * which enables you to react on any text change.
 *
 * **Note:** If you are using the `Input` as a single npm module,
 * don't forget to import the `InputSuggestions` module from
 * "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js"
 * to enable the suggestions functionality.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The `Input` provides the following keyboard shortcuts:
 *
 * - [Escape] - Closes the suggestion list, if open. If closed or not enabled, cancels changes and reverts to the value which the Input field had when it got the focus.
 * - [Enter] or [Return] - If suggestion list is open takes over the current matching item and closes it. If value state or group header is focused, does nothing.
 * - [Down] - Focuses the next matching item in the suggestion list. Selection-change event is fired.
 * - [Up] - Focuses the previous matching item in the suggestion list. Selection-change event is fired.
 * - [Home] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret before the first character. If focus is in the list, highlights the first item and updates the input accordingly.
 * - [End] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret after the last character. If focus is in the list, highlights the last item and updates the input accordingly.
 * - [Page Up] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight up by page size (10 items by default). If focus is in the input, does nothing.
 * - [Page Down] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight down by page size (10 items by default). If focus is in the input, does nothing.
 *
 *
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js";` (optional - for input suggestions support)
