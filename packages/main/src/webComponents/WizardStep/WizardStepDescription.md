A component that represents a logical step as part of the `Wizard`. It is meant to aggregate arbitrary HTML elements that form the content of a single step.
### Structure

*   Each wizard step has arbitrary content.
*   Each wizard step might have texts - defined by the `titleText` and `subtitleText` properties.
*   Each wizard step might have an icon - defined by the `icon` property.
*   Each wizard step might display a number in place of the `icon`, when it's missing.

### Usage

The `WizardStep` component should be used only as slot of the `Wizard` component and should not be used standalone
