/**
 * A component that represents a logical step as part of the `Wizard`.
 * It is meant to aggregate arbitrary HTML elements that form the content of a single step.
 *
 * ### Structure
 *
 * - Each wizard step has arbitrary content.
 * - Each wizard step might have texts - defined by the `titleText` and `subtitleText` properties.
 * - Each wizard step might have an icon - defined by the `icon` property.
 * - Each wizard step might display a number in place of the `icon`, when it's missing.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * The `WizardStep` component should be used only as slot of the `Wizard` component
 * and should not be used standalone.
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
