 * Enables users to navigate between items by providing a list of links to previous steps in the user's navigation path.

 * in a drop-down menu.
 *
 * You can choose the type of separator to be used from a number of predefined options.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The `Breadcrumbs` provides advanced keyboard handling.
 *
 * - [F4], [Alt] + [Up], [Alt] + [Down], [Space], or [Enter] - If the dropdown arrow is focused - opens/closes the drop-down.
 * - [Space],[Enter] - Activates the focused item and triggers the `item-click` event.
 * - [Escape] - Closes the drop-down.
 * - [Left] - If the drop-down is closed - navigates one item to the left.
 * - [Right] - If the drop-down is closed - navigates one item to the right.
 * - [Up] - If the drop-down is open - moves focus to the next item.
 * - [Down] - If the drop-down is open - moves focus to the previous item.
 * - [Home] - Navigates to the first item.
 * - [End] - Navigates to the last item.
 *
