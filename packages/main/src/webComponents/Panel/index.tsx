/**
 * The `Panel` component is a container which has a header and a
 * content area and is used
 * for grouping and displaying information. It can be collapsed to save space on the screen.
 *
 * ### Guidelines:
 *
 * - Nesting two or more panels is not recommended.
 * - Do not stack too many panels on one page.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * The panel's header area consists of a title bar with a header text or custom header.
 *
 * The header is clickable and can be used to toggle between the expanded and collapsed state. It includes an icon which rotates depending on the state.
 *
 * The custom header can be set through the `header` slot and it may contain arbitraray content, such as: title, buttons or any other HTML elements.
 *
 * The content area can contain an arbitrary set of controls.
 *
 * **Note:** The custom header is not clickable out of the box, but in this case the icon is interactive and allows to show/hide the content area.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 *
 * - If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are
 * resized responsively,
 * depending on its parent container.
 * - If the panel has a fixed height, it will take up the space even if the panel is
 * collapsed.
 * - When the panel is expandable (the `fixed` property is set to `false`),
 * an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header.
 * - When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or
 * close the content area.
 * - When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees
 * clockwise/counter-clockwise.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
