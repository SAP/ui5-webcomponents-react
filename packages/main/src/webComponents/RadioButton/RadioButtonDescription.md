## Keyboard Handling

Once the `RadioButton` is on focus, it might be selected by pressing the Space and Enter keys.  
The Arrow Down/Arrow Up and Arrow Left/Arrow Right keys can be used to change selection between next/previous radio buttons in one group, while TAB and SHIFT + TAB can be used to enter or leave the radio button group.  
**Note:** On entering radio button group, the focus goes to the currently selected radio button.
