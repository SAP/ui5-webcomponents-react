 * ### Overview
 *
 * A `MultiInput` field allows the user to enter multiple values, which are displayed as `Token`. User can choose interaction for creating tokens. Fiori Guidelines say that user should create tokens when:
 *
 * *   Type a value in the input and press enter or focus out the input field (`onChange` event is fired)
 * *   Select a value from the suggestion list
 * (`onSuggestionItemSelect` event is fired)
 *
 * __Note:__ This component is a web component developed by the UI5 Web Componentsâ€™ team.
