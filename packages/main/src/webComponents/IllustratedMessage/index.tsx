/**
 * An IllustratedMessage is a recommended combination of a solution-oriented message, an engaging
 * illustration, and conversational tone to better communicate an empty or a success state than just show
 * a message alone.
 *
 * Each illustration has default internationalised title and subtitle texts. Also they can be managed with
 * `titleText` and `subtitleText` properties.
 *
 * To display the desired illustration, use the `name` property, where you can find the list of all available illustrations.
 *
 * **Note:** By default the “BeforeSearch” illustration is loaded. To use other illustrations, make sure you import them in addition, for example:
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/illustrations/NoData.js"`
 *
 * **Note:** Illustrations starting with the “Tnt” prefix are part of another illustration set. For example to use the “TntSuccess” illustration, add the following import::
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/illustrations/tnt/Success.js"`
 *
 * ### Structure
 * The IllustratedMessage consists of the following elements, which are displayed below each other in the following order:
 *
 * - Illustration
 * - Title
 * - Subtitle
 * - Actions
 *
 * ### Usage
 * `IllustratedMessage` is meant to be used inside container component, for example a `ui5-card`,
 * a `ui5-dialog` or a `Page`
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
