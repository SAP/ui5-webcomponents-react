   * __Note:__ The content of the prop will be rendered into a [&lt;slot&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/slot) by assigning the respective [slot](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/slot) attribute (`slot="overflowButton"`).
   * Since you can't change the DOM order of slots when declaring them within a prop, it might prove beneficial to manually mount them as part of the component's children, especially when facing problems with the reading order of screen readers.
   *
   * __Note:__ When passing a custom React component to this prop, you have to make sure your component reads the `slot` prop and appends it to the most outer element of your component.

/**
 * Displays a group of avatars arranged horizontally. It is useful to visually
 * showcase a group of related avatars, such as, project team members or employees.
 *
 * The component allows you to display the avatars in different sizes,
 * depending on your use case.
 *
 * The `AvatarGroup` component has two group types:
 *
 * - `Group` type: The avatars are displayed as partially overlapped on
 * top of each other and the entire group has one click/tap area.
 * - `Individual` type: The avatars are displayed side-by-side and each
 * avatar has its own click/tap area.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * Use the `AvatarGroup` if:
 *
 * - You want to display a group of avatars.
 * - You want to display several avatars which have something in common.
 *
 * Do not use the `AvatarGroup` if:
 *
 * - You want to display a single avatar.
 * - You want to display a gallery for simple images.
 * - You want to use it for other visual content than avatars.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 *
 * When the available space is less than the width required to display all avatars,
 * an overflow visualization appears as a button placed at the end with the same shape
 * and size as the avatars. The visualization displays the number of avatars that have overflowed
 * and are not currently visible.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The component provides advanced keyboard handling.
 * When focused, the user can use the following keyboard
 * shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:
 *
 * `type` Individual:
 *
 * - [Tab] - Move focus to the overflow button
 * - [Left] - Navigate one avatar to the left
 * - [Right] - Navigate one avatar to the right
 * - [Home] - Navigate to the first avatar
 * - [End] - Navigate to the last avatar
 * - [Space] / [Enter] or [Return] - Trigger `ui5-click` event
 *
 * `type` Group:
 *
 * - [Tab] - Move focus to the next interactive element after the component
 * - [Space] / [Enter] or [Return] - Trigger `ui5-click` event
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
