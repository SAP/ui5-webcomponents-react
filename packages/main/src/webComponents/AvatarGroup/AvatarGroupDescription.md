## Responsive Behavior

When the available space is less than the width required to display all avatars, an overflow visualization appears as a button placed at the end with the same shape and size as the avatars. The visualization displays the number of avatars that have overflowed and are not currently visible.

## Usage

Use the `AvatarGroup` if:

*   You want to display a group of avatars.
*   You want to display several avatars which have something in common.

Do not use the `AvatarGroup` if:

*   You want to display a single avatar.
*   You want to display a gallery for simple images.
*   You want to use it for other visual content than avatars.

The component provides advanced keyboard handling. When focused, the user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:  
\- `type` Individual:  

*   \[TAB\] - Move focus to the overflow button
*   \[LEFT\] - Navigate one avatar to the left
*   \[RIGHT\] - Navigate one avatar to the right
*   \[HOME\] - Navigate to the first avatar
*   \[END\] - Navigate to the last avatar

\- `type` Group:
