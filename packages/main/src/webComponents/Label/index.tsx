/**
 * The `Label` is a component used to represent a label, providing valuable information to the user. Usually it is placed next to a value holder, such as a text field. It informs the user about what data is displayed or expected in the value holder.
 *
 * The `Label` appearance can be influenced by properties, such as `required` and `wrap`. The appearance of the Label can be configured in a limited way by using the design property. For a broader choice of designs, you can use custom styles.
