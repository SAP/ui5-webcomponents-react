 * The `FileUploader` opens a file explorer dialog and enables users to upload files.

Furthermore, you can set the property "hideInput" to "true" to hide the input field.
 * To get all selected files, you can simply use the read-only "files" property. To restrict the types of files the user can select, you can use the "accept" property.
 * And, similar to all input based components, the FileUploader supports "valueState", "placeholder", "name", and "disabled" properties. For the `FileUploader`
