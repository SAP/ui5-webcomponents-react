## Usage Guidelines

- If the text is longer than the width of the component, it doesn’t wrap, it shows ellipsis.
- When truncated, the full text is not visible, therefore, it’s recommended to make more space for longer texts to be fully displayed.
- Colors are not semantic and have no visual representation in High Contrast Black (sap_belize_hcb) theme.
