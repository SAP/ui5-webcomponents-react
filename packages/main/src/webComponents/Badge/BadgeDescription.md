## Usage Guidelines

*   If the text is longer than the width of the component, it doesn’t wrap, it shows ellipsis.
*   When truncated, the full text is not visible, therefore, it’s recommended to make more space for longer texts to be fully displayed.
*   Colors are not semantic and have no visual representation in High Contrast Black (sap\_belize\_hcb) theme.
