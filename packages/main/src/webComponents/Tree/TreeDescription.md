## Usage

### When to use:

*   To display hierarchically structured items.
*   To select one or more items out of a set of hierarchically structured items.

### When not to use:

*   To display items not hierarchically strcutured. In this case, use the List component.
*   To select one item from a very small number of non-hierarchical items. Select or ComboBox might be more appropriate.
*   The hierarchy turns out to have only two levels. In this case, use List with group items.

## Keyboard Handling

The `Tree` provides advanced keyboard handling. The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to navigate trough the tree:

*   \[UP/DOWN\] - Navigates up and down the tree items that are currently visible.
*   \[RIGHT\] - Drills down the tree by expanding the tree nodes.
*   \[LEFT\] - Goes up the tree and collapses the tree nodes.

  
The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to perform selection, when the `mode` property is in use:

*   \[SPACE\] - Selects the currently focused item upon keyup.
*   \[ENTER\] - Selects the currently focused item upon keydown.
