 *
 * However, users are able to customize the width of `Switch` with pure CSS (`<Switch style="width: 200px">`), and set widths, depending on the texts they would use.
 *
 * Note: the component would not automatically stretch to fit the whole text width.

 * The state can be changed by pressing the Space and Enter keys.
