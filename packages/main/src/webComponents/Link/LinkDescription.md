## Usage

You can set the `Link` to be enabled or disabled.  
  
To create a visual hierarchy in large lists of links, you can set the less important links as `Subtle` or the more important ones as `Emphasized`, by using the `design` property.  
  
If the `href` property is set, the link behaves as the HTML anchor tag (`<a><a/>`) and opens the specified URL in the given target frame (`target` property). To specify where the linked content is opened, you can use the `target` property.

## Responsive behavior

If there is not enough space, the text of the `Link` becomes truncated. If the `wrappingType` property is set to `"Normal"`, the text is displayed on several lines instead of being truncated.
