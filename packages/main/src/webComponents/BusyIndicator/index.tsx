/**
 * The `BusyIndicator` signals that some operation is going on and that the
 * user must wait. It does not block the current UI screen so other operations could be triggered in parallel.
 * It displays 3 dots and each dot expands and shrinks at a different rate, resulting in a cascading flow of animation.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * For the `BusyIndicator` you can define the size, the text and whether it is shown or hidden.
 * In order to hide it, use the "active" property.
 *
 * In order to show busy state over an HTML element, simply nest the HTML element in a `BusyIndicator` instance.
 *
 * **Note:** Since `BusyIndicator` has `display: inline-block;` by default and no width of its own,
 * whenever you need to wrap a block-level element, you should set `display: block` to the busy indicator as well.
 *
 * #### When to use:
 *
 * - The user needs to be able to cancel the operation.
 * - Only part of the application or a particular component is affected.
 *
 * #### When not to use:
 *
 * - The operation takes less than one second.
 * - You need to block the screen and prevent the user from starting another activity.
 * - Do not show multiple busy indicators at once.
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
