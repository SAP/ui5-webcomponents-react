`MenuItem` is the item to use inside a `Menu`. An arbitrary hierarchy structure can be represented by recursively nesting menu items.

### Usage

`MenuItem` is an abstract element, representing a node in a `Menu`. The menu itself is rendered as a list, and each `MenuItem` is represented by a list item (`StandardListItem`) in that list. Therefore, you should only use `MenuItem` directly in your apps. The `StandardListItem` list item is internal for the list, and not intended for public use.
