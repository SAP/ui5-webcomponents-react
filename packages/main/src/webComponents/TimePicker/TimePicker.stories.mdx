## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {(args) => {
      return <TimePicker {...args} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Properties

<ArgsTable story="." />

## Usage

The user can enter a time by:

- Using the sliders that opens in a popup
- Typing it in directly in the input field

When the user makes an entry and chooses the enter key, the sliders shows the corresponding time. When the user directly triggers the sliders display, the actual time is displayed. For the `TimePicker`

## Formatting

If a time is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format.

Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information, see <ui5-link target="_blank" href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table" class="api-table-content-cell-link">UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language</ui5-link>.

For example, if the `format-pattern` is "HH:mm:ss", a valid value string is "11:42:35" and the same is displayed in the input.
