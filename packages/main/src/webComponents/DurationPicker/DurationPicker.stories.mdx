## Usage

The Duration Picker is used for input of time. Users are able to select hours, minutes and seconds. The user can enter a time by:

- Using the sliders that opens in a popup
- Typing it in directly in the input field

When the user makes an entry and chooses the enter key, the sliders shows the corresponding time. When the user directly triggers the sliders display, the actual time is displayed. For the `DurationPicker`
