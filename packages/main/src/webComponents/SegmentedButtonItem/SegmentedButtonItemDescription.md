Users can use the `SegmentedButtonItem` as part of a `SegmentedButton`.

Clicking or tapping on a `SegmentedButtonItem` changes its state to `pressed`. The item returns to its initial state when the user clicks or taps on it again. By applying additional custom CSS-styling classes, apps can give a different style to any `SegmentedButtonItem`.
