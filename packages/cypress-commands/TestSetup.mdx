# Cypress Test Setup

UI5 Web Components for React is using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) as preferred testing framework. There you have the options of testing components only or create End-to-End tests for your application.

## Configuration

When launching Cypress the first time you're guided through the setup, which then will create a [configuration file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for you. You can use any configuration you like, but since we're heavily relying on web-components, we recommend traversing the shadow DOM per default:

```js
includeShadowDom: true;
```

[Here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/react/quickstart) you can find the Cypress Quickstart tutorial for React.

## ThemeProvider

UI5 Web Components for React components have to be wrapped inside a `ThemeProvider`, depending on your test setup (especially for component-testing) it might prove beneficial creating a custom `mount` command, that includes the `ThemeProvider`.

JavaScript:

```js
/**
 * Cypress mount with ThemeProvider
 */
Cypress.Commands.add('mount', (component, options) => {
  return mount(<ThemeProvider>{component}</ThemeProvider>, options);
});
```

TypeScript declaration:

```ts
declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      /**
       * Cypress mount with ThemeProvider
       */
      mount: typeof mount;
    }
  }
}
```

You can define the command for example in the `commands.ts/js` file:

<details>

<summary>Example file</summary>

```tsx
import { mount } from 'cypress/react18';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@ui5/webcomponents-react';

declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable {
      /**
       * Cypress mount with ThemeProvider
       */
      mount: typeof mount;
    }
  }
}

/**
 * Cypress mount with ThemeProvider
 */
Cypress.Commands.add('mount', (component, options) => {
  return mount(<ThemeProvider>{component}</ThemeProvider>, options);
});
```

</details>

## Cypress Commands package for ui5-webcomponents

<MessageStrip
  hideCloseButton
  children="This package is a work-in-progress and can be extended by you! If you feel like a command or query is missing, please
  feel free to open a PR adding it to our library. Contributions are always welcome!"
/>

Since testing web components is sometimes not as straightforward as one would like it to be, we offer a package with a set of commands and queries to make it easier to interact with them:

Install:

```sh
npm install @ui5/webcomponents-cypress-commands
```

After the installation you can import it in your entry file (e.g. `component.ts`):

```ts
import '@ui5/webcomponents-cypress-commands';
```

Now you can use all commands and queries that are available in this package.
