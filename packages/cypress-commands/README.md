Since testing web components is sometimes not as straightforward as one would like it to be, we offer a package with a set of commands and queries to make it easier to interact with them:

## Installation

```sh
npm install @ui5/webcomponents-cypress-commands
```

After the installation you can import it in your entry file (e.g. `component.ts`):

```ts
import '@ui5/webcomponents-cypress-commands';
```

Now you can use all commands and queries that are available in this package.

> You can find a detailed description of all available commands and queries [here](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents-react/?path=/docs/testing-with-cypress-setup--docs)
